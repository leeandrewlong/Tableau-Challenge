# Tableau-Challenge

For my tableau homework I looked at a few trends and was surprised about a few for the month of March 2022.

  1. I wouldve thought that Electric bikes would be rented the most!
  2. I also noticed/expected that the higher rental stations would be located near the park(s) or near some body of water.
  3. Casual bike riders averaged longer distances due to inconsisent rental counts
  4. Rental volumes vs. time of day was as expected....during "rush hours" in morning and evening when employees are leaving work or have free time for leisure.
